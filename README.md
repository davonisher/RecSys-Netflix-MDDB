Personalized Movie and jokes Recommendation System
This project is a simple recommendation system for both movies and jokes using the Netflix and Jester datasets. It helps users find new movies and jokes they might like, based on their previous ratings and the similarities between items. The recommendation system is built using machine learning models like KNN and SVD collaborative filtering techniques.
